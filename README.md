# Morel
Standard ML interpreter, with relational extensions, implemented in Java

(Morel was known as smlj until version 0.1, and hosted at
[GitHub/julianhyde](https://github.com/julianhyde/morel)
until version 0.2.)

## Requirements

Java version 11 or higher.

## Get Morel

### From Maven

Get Morel from
<a href="https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3Anet.hydromatic%20a%3Amorel">Maven Central</a>:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>net.hydromatic</groupId>
  <artifactId>morel</artifactId>
  <version>0.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Download and build

```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/hydromatic/morel.git
$ cd morel
$ ./mvnw install
```

On Windows, the last line is

```bash
> mvnw install
```

If you are using Java 8, you should add parameters `-Dcheckstyle.version=9.3`.

### Run the shell

```bash
$ ./morel
morel version 0.2.0 (java version "13", JLine terminal, xterm-256color)
- "Hello, world!";
val it = "Hello, world!" : string
- exit
$
```

Within the shell, the `use` function reads and evaluates source from a
file:

```bash
- use "script.sml";
```

## Documentation

* [Morel language reference](docs/reference.md)
* ["How to" guide](docs/howto.md)
* [Change log](HISTORY.md)
* Reading [test reference logs](src/test/resources/script)
  can be instructive; try, for example,
  [relational.sml.out](src/test/resources/script/relational.sml.out)

Bugs:
* Prevent user from overriding built-in constants and functions:
  `true`, `false`, `nil`, `ref`, `it`, `::`; they should not be reserved
* Access parameters and variables by offset into a fixed-size array;
  currently we address them by name, in a map that is copied far too often
* Runtime should raise `Div` when divide by zero
* Validator should give good user error when it cannot type an expression

## Extensions

Morel has a few extensions to Standard ML: postfix labels,
implicit labels in record expressions, and relational extensions.
Postfix labels and implicit labels are intended to make relational
expressions more concise and more similar to SQL but they can be used
anywhere in Morel, not just in relational expressions.

### Postfix labels

Morel allows '.' for field references.
Thus `e.deptno` is equivalent to `#deptno e`.

(Postfix labels are implemented as syntactic sugar; both expressions
become an application of label `#deptno` to expression `e`.)

Because '.' is left-associative, it is a more convenient syntax for
chained references. In the standard syntax, `e.address.zipcode` would
be written `#zipcode (#address e)`.

### Implicit labels in record expressions

In standard ML, a record expression is of the form
`{label1 = exp1, label2 = exp2, ...}`; in Morel, you can omit `label =`
if the expression is an identifier, label application, or field reference.

Thus
```
{#deptno e, e.name, d}
```
is short-hand for
```
{deptno = #deptno e, name = e.name, d = d}
```

In the relational extensions, `group` and `compute` expressions also use
implicit labels. For instance,
```
from e in emps
  group e.deptno compute sum of e.salary, count
```
is short-hand for
```
from e in emps
  group deptno = e.deptno compute sum = sum of e.salary, count = count
```
and both expressions have type `{count:int,deptno:int,sum:int} list`.

### Relational extensions

The `from` expression (and associated `in`, `join`, `where`,
`group`, `compute`, `order` and `yield` keywords)
is a language extension to support relational algebra.
It iterates over a list and generates another list.

In a sense, `from` is syntactic sugar. For example, given `emps` and
`depts`, relations defined as lists of records as follows

```
val emps =
  [{id = 100, name = "Fred", deptno = 10},
   {id = 101, name = "Velma", deptno = 20},
   {id = 102, name = "Shaggy", deptno = 30},
   {id = 103, name = "Scooby", deptno = 30}];
val depts =
  [{deptno = 10, name = "Sales"},
   {deptno = 20, name = "Marketing"},
   {deptno = 30, name = "Engineering"},
   {deptno = 40, name = "Support"}];
```

the expression

```
from e in emps where e.deptno = 30 yield e.id
```

is equivalent to standard ML

```
map (fn e => (#id e)) (filter (fn e => (#deptno e) = 30) emps)
```

with the `where` and `yield` clauses emulating the `filter` and `map`
higher-order functions without the need for lambdas (`fn`).

Relational expressions are an experiment bringing the features of
query languages such as SQL into a functional language.
We believe that a little syntactic sugar, backed by a relational query
planner, makes ML into a powerful and convenient tool for querying
large data sets.
Conversely, we want to see how SQL would look if it supported lambdas,
function-values, polymorphism, pattern-matching, and removed the
syntactic distinction between tables and collection-valued columns.

You can iterate over more than one collection, and therefore generate
a join or a cartesian product:

```
from e in emps,
    d in depts
  where e.deptno = d.deptno
  yield {e.id, e.deptno, ename = e.name, dname = d.name};
```

As in any ML expression, you can define functions within a `from` expression,
and those functions can operate on lists. Thus we can implement equivalents of
SQL's `IN` and `EXISTS` operators:

```
let
  fun in_ e [] = false
    | in_ e (h :: t) = e = h orelse (in_ e t)
in
  from e in emps
    where in_ e.deptno (from d in depts
        where d.name = "Engineering"
        yield d.deptno)
    yield e.name
end;

let
  fun exists [] = false
    | exists (hd :: tl) = true
in
  from e in emps
    where exists (from d in depts
        where d.deptno = e.deptno
        andalso d.name = "Engineering")
    yield e.name
end;
```

In the second query, note that the sub-query inside the `exists` is
correlated (references the `e` variable from the enclosing query)
and skips the `yield` clause (because it doesn't matter which columns
the sub-query returns, just whether it returns any rows).

There are now built-in operators `elem` and `exists`, so you can write
```
from e in emps
  where e.deptno elem (from d in depts
      where d.name = "Engineering"
      yield d.deptno)
  yield e.name;

from e in emps
  where exists (from d in depts
      where d.deptno = e.deptno
      andalso d.name = "Engineering");
```
