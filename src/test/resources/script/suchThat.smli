(* The following example from Souffle,
 * https://souffle-lang.github.io/simple.
 *
 * Say we have a Datalog file example.dl, whose contents are as shown:
 *
 *   .decl edge(x:number, y:number)
 *   .input edge
 *
 *   .decl path(x:number, y:number)
 *   .output path
 *
 *   path(x, y) :- edge(x, y).
 *   path(x, y) :- path(x, z), edge(z, y).
 *
 * We see that edge is a .input relation, and so will be read from disk. Also,
 * path is a .output relation, and so will be written to disk.
 *
 * The last two lines say that 1) "there is a path from x to y if there is an
 * edge from x to y", and 2) "there is a path from x to y if there is a path
 * from x to some z, and there is an edge from that z to y".
 *
 * So if the input edge relation is pairs of vertices in a graph, by these two
 * rules the output path relation will give us all pairs of vertices x and y for
 * which a path exists in that graph from x to y.
 *
 * For instance, if the contents of the tab-separated input file edge.facts is
 *
 *   1  2
 *   2  3
 *
 * The contents of the output file path.csv, after we evaluate this program,
 * will be
 *
 *   1  2
 *   2  3
 *   1  3
 *)
