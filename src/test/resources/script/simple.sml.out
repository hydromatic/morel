(*
sml prints the following, but we cannot split types yet:

val it = {a=1,b={a=2,b={a=3,b={a=4,b={a=#,b=#}}}}}
  : {a:int,
     b:{a:int, b:{a:int, b:{a:int, b:{a:int, b:{a:int, b:{a:int, b:unit}}}}}}}
*)
{a=1,b={a=2,b={a=3,b={a=4,b={a=5,b={a=6,b={a=7,b={}}}}}}}};
val it = {a=1,b={a=2,b={a=3,b={a=4,b={a=#,b=#}}}}}
  : {a:int, b:{a:int, b:{a:int, b:{a:int, b:{a:int, b:{a:int, b:{a:int, b:unit}}}}}}}


(*) Bug: Fails due to lack of parentheses
(*
let
  fun in_ e [] = false
    | in_ e (h :: t) = e = h orelse in_ e t
in
  (in_ 3 [1,2,3], in_ 4 [1,2,3])
end;
*)

(*) Succeeds when parentheses are added
let
  fun in_ e [] = false
    | in_ e (h :: t) = e = h orelse (in_ e t)
in
  (in_ 3 [1,2,3], in_ 4 [1,2,3])
end;
val it = (true,false) : bool * bool


(*) Lambda on unit
fn () => 1;
val it = fn : unit -> int

it ();
val it = 1 : int


(*) Multiple functions
let
  fun f x = 1
  fun g x = 2
in
  f (g 0)
end;
val it = 1 : int


(*) Closure
let
  fun f x = 1 + x;
  val x = f 2;
  fun f y = x + y;
  val x = 10
in
  f x
end;
val it = 13 : int


(*) As "Closure", but each 'fun' is replaced with a lambda.
let
  val f = fn x => 1 + x;
  val x = f 2;
  val f = fn y => x + y;
  val x = 10
in
  f x
end;
val it = 13 : int


(*) As "Closure", but converted to nested 'let' expressions.
let
  fun f x = 1 + x
in
  let
    val x = f 2
  in
    let
      fun g y = x + y
    in
      let
        val x = 10
      in
        g x
      end
    end
  end
end;
val it = 13 : int


(*) Similar to "Closure", but a simpler expression.
let
  val x = 1;
  fun f y = x + y;
  val x = 10;
in
  f x
end;
val it = 11 : int


(*) Similar to "Closure", but the two occurrences of 'x'
(*) have different data types, so that the bug is more obvious.
let
  val x = "abc";
  fun g y = String_size x + y;
  val x = 10
in
  g x
end;
val it = 13 : int


(*) As previous, but converting 'fun' to a lambda.
let
  val x = "abc";
  val g = fn y => String_size x + y;
  val x = 10
in
  g x
end;
val it = 13 : int


(*) A fun in a fun (test case for [MOREL-19])
fun foo arg =
  let
    fun baz x = x
  in
    baz arg
  end;
val foo = fn : 'a -> 'a

foo 3;
val it = 3 : 'a


(*) More complex test case for [MOREL-19]
fun wordcount lines =
  let
    fun split0 [] word words = word :: words
      | split0 (#" " :: s) word words = split0 s "" (word :: words)
      | split0 (c :: s) word words = split0 s (word ^ (String_str c)) words
    fun split s = List_rev (split0 (String_explode s) "" [])
  in
    from line in lines,
        word in split(line)
    group word compute count = count of 1
  end;
val wordcount = fn : string list -> {count:int, word:string} list

wordcount ["michael where mary had had had",
  "had had had had",
  "had had had had the teacher's approval"];
val it =
  [{count=1,word="michael"},{count=1,word="the"},{count=1,word="teacher's"},
   {count=1,word="approval"},{count=1,word="mary"},{count=1,word="where"},
   {count=11,word="had"}] : {count:int, word:string} list
