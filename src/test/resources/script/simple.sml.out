val x = 1 : int

x + 2;
val it = 3 : int

let
  fun fact n =
    if n = 0
    then 1

(* Disabled due to bug linking recursive functions at top-level
fun str s 0 l = l
  | str s i l = str ("a" ^ s) (i - 1) (s :: l);
val str = fn : string -> int -> string list -> string list

str "" 10 [];
val it =
  ["aaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaa","aaaaaaa","aaaaaa","aaaaa","aaaa","aaa","aa","a",""]
  : string list

(*) Note how long lists are wrapped and abbreviated
str "" 20 [];
val it =
  ["aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
   "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaaaaaa",
   "aaaaaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaa",...]
  : string list

(*) Bug: Fails due to lack of parentheses
(*
let
  fun in_ e [] = false
    | in_ e (h :: t) = e = h orelse in_ e t
in
  (in_ 3 [1,2,3], in_ 4 [1,2,3])
end;
*)

(*) Succeeds when parentheses are added
let
  fun in_ e [] = false
    | in_ e (h :: t) = e = h orelse (in_ e t)
in
  (in_ 3 [1,2,3], in_ 4 [1,2,3])
end;
val it = (true,false) : bool * bool


(*) Multiple functions
let
  fun f x = 1
  fun g x = 2
in
  f (g 0)
end;
val it = 1 : int


(*) Closure
let
  fun f x = 1 + x;
  val x = f 2;
  fun f y = x + y;
  val x = 10
in
  f x
end;
val it = 13 : int


(*) As "Closure", but each 'fun' is replaced with a lambda.
let
  val f = fn x => 1 + x;
  val x = f 2;
  val f = fn y => x + y;
  val x = 10
in
  f x
end;
val it = 13 : int


(*) As "Closure", but converted to nested 'let' expressions.
let
  fun f x = 1 + x
in
  let
    val x = f 2
  in
    let
      fun g y = x + y
    in
      let
        val x = 10
      in
        g x
      end
    end
  end
end;
val it = 13 : int


(*) Similar to "Closure", but a simpler expression.
let
  val x = 1;
  fun f y = x + y;
  val x = 10;
in
  f x
end;
val it = 11 : int


(*) Similar to "Closure", but the two occurrences of 'x'
(*) have different data types, so that the bug is more obvious.
let
  val x = "abc";
  fun g y = String_size x + y;
  val x = 10
in
  g x
end;
val it = 13 : int


(*) As previous, but converting 'fun' to a lambda.
let
  val x = "abc";
  val g = fn y => String_size x + y;
  val x = 10
in
  g x
end;
val it = 13 : int
