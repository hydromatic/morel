(*) Simple commands
1;
val it = 1 : int

val x = 1;
val x = 1 : int

x + 2;
val it = 3 : int

let
  fun fact n =
    if n = 0
    then 1
    else n * (fact (n - 1))
in
  fact 5
end;
val it = 120 : int

let
  fun sum x y = x + y
in
  sum 2
end;
val it = fn : int -> int

it 3;
val it = 5 : int


(* Disabled due to bug linking recursive functions at top-level
fun str s 0 l = l
  | str s i l = str ("a" ^ s) (i - 1) (s :: l);
val str = fn : string -> int -> string list -> string list

str "" 10 [];
val it =
  ["aaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaa","aaaaaaa","aaaaaa","aaaaa","aaaa","aaa","aa","a",""]
  : string list

(*) Note how long lists are wrapped and abbreviated
str "" 20 [];
val it =
  ["aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
   "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaaaaaa",
   "aaaaaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaa",...]
  : string list
*)

(*) Bug: Fails due to lack of parentheses
(*
let
  fun in_ e [] = false
    | in_ e (h :: t) = e = h orelse in_ e t
in
  (in_ 3 [1,2,3], in_ 4 [1,2,3])
end;
*)

(*) Succeeds when parentheses are added
let
  fun in_ e [] = false
    | in_ e (h :: t) = e = h orelse (in_ e t)
in
  (in_ 3 [1,2,3], in_ 4 [1,2,3])
end;
val it = [true, false] : bool * bool
