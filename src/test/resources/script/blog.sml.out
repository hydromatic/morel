(*) === README.md ===================================================

(*) Auxiliary declarations
val e = {deptno = 10, name = "Fred"};
val e = {deptno=10,name="Fred"} : {deptno:int, name:string}

val d = 10;
val d = 10 : int

val filter = List_filter;
val filter = fn : ('a -> bool) -> 'a list -> 'a list


"Hello, world!";
val it = "Hello, world!" : string


(*) In Morel, you can omit label = if the expression is an identifier,
(*) label application, or field reference. Thus
{#deptno e, e.name, d};
val it = {d=10,deptno=10,name="Fred"} : {d:int, deptno:int, name:string}

(*) is short-hand for
{deptno = #deptno e, name = e.name, d = d};
val it = {d=10,deptno=10,name="Fred"} : {d:int, deptno:int, name:string}


(*) In a sense, from is syntactic sugar. For example, given emps and
(*) depts, relations defined as lists of records as follows
val emps =
  [{id = 100, name = "Fred", deptno = 10},
   {id = 101, name = "Velma", deptno = 20},
   {id = 102, name = "Shaggy", deptno = 30},
   {id = 103, name = "Scooby", deptno = 30}];
val emps =
  [{deptno=10,id=100,name="Fred"},{deptno=20,id=101,name="Velma"},
   {deptno=30,id=102,name="Shaggy"},{deptno=30,id=103,name="Scooby"}] : {deptno:int, id:int, name:string} list

val depts =
  [{deptno = 10, name = "Sales"},
   {deptno = 20, name = "Marketing"},
   {deptno = 30, name = "Engineering"},
   {deptno = 40, name = "Support"}];
val depts =
  [{deptno=10,name="Sales"},{deptno=20,name="Marketing"},
   {deptno=30,name="Engineering"},{deptno=40,name="Support"}] : {deptno:int, name:string} list

(*) the expression
from e in emps where e.deptno = 30 yield e.id;
val it = [102,103] : int list

(*) is equivalent to standard ML
(* FIXME
map (fn e => (#id e)) (filter (fn e => (#deptno e) = 30) emps);
*)

(*) You can iterate over more than one collection, and therefore
(*) generate a join or a cartesian product:
from e in emps, d in depts
  where e.deptno = d.deptno
  yield {e.id, e.deptno, ename = e.name, dname = d.name};
val it =
  [{deptno=10,dname="Sales",ename="Fred",id=100},
   {deptno=20,dname="Marketing",ename="Velma",id=101},
   {deptno=30,dname="Engineering",ename="Shaggy",id=102},
   {deptno=30,dname="Engineering",ename="Scooby",id=103}] : {deptno:int, dname:string, ename:string, id:int} list

(*) As in any ML expression, you can define functions within a from
(*) expression, and those functions can operate on lists. Thus we can
(*) implement equivalents of SQL's IN and EXISTS operators:
(* FIXME
let
  fun in_ e [] = false
    | in_ e (h :: t) = e = h orelse (in_ e t)
in
  from e in emps
  where in_ e.deptno (from d in depts
                where d.name = "Engineering"
                yield d.deptno)
  yield e.name
end;
*)
(* FIXME
let
  fun exists [] = false
    | exists hd :: tl = true
in
  from e in emps
  where exists (from d in depts
                where d.deptno = e.deptno
                andalso d.name = "Engineering")
  yield e.name
end;
*)

(*) === Screen cast =================================================

(*) Now we're in smlj's shell, for interactive commands.
(*) First of all, we need to talk about comments.

(* This is a block comment, which can span multiple lines... *)

(*) ... and this is a single-line comment.

(*) Now, the basics.
(*) Everything in ML is an expression.
"a string literal";
val it = "a string literal" : string

1 + 2;
val it = 3 : int


(*) The smlj shell deduces the type of each expression,
(*) and assigns it to a variable called "it".
(*) We can use "it" in the next expression...
it + 4;
val it = 7 : int


(*) We just saw string and int expressions.
(*) There are also boolean, list, record and tuple types:
1 = 2;
val it = false : bool

[1, 2, 3];
val it = [1,2,3] : int list

{id = 10, name = "Alex"};
val it = {id=10,name="Alex"} : {id:int, name:string}

(1, true, "yes");
val it = (1,true,"yes") : int * bool * string


(*) You can assign values to variables.
val x = 7;
val x = 7 : int

val y =  x mod 3;
val y = 1 : int


(*) Functions are expressions, too.
(*) "fn" makes a lambda expression.
val plusOne = fn x => x + 1;
val plusOne = fn : int -> int

plusOne 2;
val it = 3 : int


(*) Functions are widely used, so they have a shorthand.
(*) "fun" is short for "val ... = fn".
fun plusOne x = x + 1;
val plusOne = fn : int -> int

plusOne 1000;
val it = 1001 : int


(*) Functions can have multiple arguments, separated by spaces.
fun plus x y = x + y;
val plus = fn : int -> int -> int

plus 3 4;
val it = 7 : int


(*) If we supply too few arguments, we get a closure that captures
(*) the argument value and can be applied later.
val plusTen = plus 10;
val plusTen = fn : int -> int

plusTen 2;
val it = 12 : int


(*) Functions can be recursive.
fun fact n = if n = 1 then 1 else n * fact (n - 1);
val fact = fn : int -> int

fact 1;
val it = 1 : int

fact 5;
val it = 120 : int


(*) A higher-order function is a function that operates on other
(*) functions. Here are a couple.

(*) "map" applies another function to each element of a list
let
  fun map f [] = []
    | map f (head :: tail) = (f head) :: (map f tail)
  fun double n = n * 2
in
  map double [1, 2, 3, 4]
end;
val it = [2,4,6,8] : int list


(*) "filter" keeps only those elements of a list for which
(*) a predicate evaluates to true.
let
  fun filter p [] = []
    | filter p (head :: tail) =
      if (p head) then
        (head :: (filter p tail))
      else
        (filter p tail)
  fun even n = n mod 2 = 0
in
  filter even [1, 2, 3, 4]
end;
val it = [2,4] : int list


(*) You may notice that "map" and "filter" are very similar to the
(*) "select" and "where" clauses of a SQL statement.
(*)
(*) This is no surprise: relational algebra, which underlies SQL, is
(*) basically a collection of higher-order functions applied to
(*) lists of records (relations).
(*)
(*) Can we extend ML syntax to make it easier to write relational
(*) algebra expressions? You bet!

(*) Let's start by defining "emp" and "dept" relations as lists of
(*) records.
val emps =
  [{id = 100, name = "Fred", deptno = 10},
   {id = 101, name = "Velma", deptno = 20},
   {id = 102, name = "Shaggy", deptno = 30},
   {id = 103, name = "Scooby", deptno = 30}];
val emps =
  [{deptno=10,id=100,name="Fred"},{deptno=20,id=101,name="Velma"},
   {deptno=30,id=102,name="Shaggy"},{deptno=30,id=103,name="Scooby"}] : {deptno:int, id:int, name:string} list

val depts =
  [{deptno = 10, name = "Sales"},
   {deptno = 20, name = "HR"},
   {deptno = 30, name = "Engineering"},
   {deptno = 40, name = "Support"}];
val depts =
  [{deptno=10,name="Sales"},{deptno=20,name="HR"},{deptno=30,name="Engineering"},
   {deptno=40,name="Support"}] : {deptno:int, name:string} list


(*) Now our first query, equivalent to "select * from emps as e".
from e in emps yield e;
val it =
  [{deptno=10,id=100,name="Fred"},{deptno=20,id=101,name="Velma"},
   {deptno=30,id=102,name="Shaggy"},{deptno=30,id=103,name="Scooby"}] : {deptno:int, id:int, name:string} list


(*) Now "select e.id from emps as e where e.deptno = 30"
from e in emps where (#deptno e) = 30 yield (#id e);
val it = [102,103] : int list


(*) Join two relations
from e in emps, d in depts
  where (#deptno e) = (#deptno d)
  yield {id = (#id e), deptno = (#deptno e),
         ename = (#name e), dname = (#name d)};
val it =
  [{deptno=10,dname="Sales",ename="Fred",id=100},
   {deptno=20,dname="HR",ename="Velma",id=101},
   {deptno=30,dname="Engineering",ename="Shaggy",id=102},
   {deptno=30,dname="Engineering",ename="Scooby",id=103}] : {deptno:int, dname:string, ename:string, id:int} list


(*) A query with "exists" and a correlated sub-query.
(*) We define the "exists" function ourselves: no need for a
(*) built-in!
let
  fun exists [] = false
    | exists (head :: tail) = true
in
  from e in emps
    where exists (from d in depts
                  where (#deptno d) = (#deptno e)
                  andalso (#name d) = "Engineering")
    yield (#name e)
end;
val it = ["Shaggy","Scooby"] : string list


(*) That's all, folks!
(*) To recap, smlj has:
(*)  * expressions of int, string, boolean, float, char, list,
(*)    tuple and record types;
(*)  * lambda expressions and recursive functions;
(*)  * algebraic datatypes and pattern-matching;
(*)  * polymorphism and powerful type-inference;
(*)  * relational expressions (an extension to Standard ML).

(*) === 2020/02/25: Morel: A functional language for data ===========

(*) === 2020/03/03: Morel: The basic language =======================

(* As a functional language, everything in Morel is an expression.
